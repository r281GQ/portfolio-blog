**Original answer:** I'm not sure if you will like how mathematical courses typically introduce matrices. As a programmer you might be happier with grabbing any decent 3D graphics book. It should certainly have very concrete 3x3 matrices. Also find out the ones that will teach you [projective transformations][1] (projective geometry is a very beautiful area of low-dimensional geometry and easy to program).
